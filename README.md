# Decentralized Science Platform (DeSci) with FHE

A Web3-native platform that empowers researchers to share, analyze, and govern access to sensitive research data without ever compromising intellectual property. By combining Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) with decentralized governance, this project enables a new paradigm for collaborative science.

## Why FHE Matters

In traditional scientific collaboration, researchers must choose between sharing raw data (risking exposure of valuable IP) or keeping data private (limiting collaboration). Fully Homomorphic Encryption changes this equation by allowing computations directly on encrypted data. This ensures that:

- Research datasets remain confidential even during computation.  
- Analysis can be verified and executed without requiring decryption.  
- Intellectual property is safeguarded while enabling collaborative insights.  

In short, FHE allows science to be both **open** and **protected**.

## Core Features

- **Encrypted Data Submission**: Researchers upload encrypted datasets to IPFS, ensuring persistent and secure storage.  
- **fhEVM Integration**: Smart contracts enforce access control and define what analyses are permissible on encrypted inputs.  
- **DAO-Driven Governance**: Token holders vote on which encrypted computations can be executed, creating a transparent and community-driven research workflow.  
- **FHE-Powered Analysis**: Complex computations run directly on encrypted data, returning results without exposing the underlying dataset.  
- **NFT Research Artifacts**: Verified research outcomes can be minted as NFTs, enabling traceable, tokenized recognition of contributions.

## Architecture Overview

1. **Data Layer** – Research datasets are encrypted client-side and uploaded to IPFS.  
2. **Access Control** – fhEVM contracts determine which parties or algorithms can process the data.  
3. **Computation** – FHE libraries execute computations on encrypted data, preserving confidentiality.  
4. **Governance** – DAO members decide which analyses are legitimate and beneficial.  
5. **Results & Recognition** – Computation outputs can be published, shared, or minted as NFTs.

## Security Considerations

- No raw dataset is ever exposed during computation.  
- Access permissions are codified on-chain via fhEVM, preventing unilateral control.  
- DAO voting prevents misuse by aligning computational decisions with collective community interest.

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1**: Core fhEVM contracts, encrypted data storage, and minimal DAO voting.  
- **Phase 2**: Full FHE integration for advanced computations and verification mechanisms.  
- **Phase 3**: NFT-based research recognition and marketplace for encrypted analysis modules.  
- **Phase 4**: Expansion into cross-chain interoperability and integration with broader Web3 research ecosystems.

### Towards a New Era of Scientific Collaboration

This project aims to make decentralized science both **collaborative** and **secure**, where researchers retain ownership of their work while benefiting from collective intelligence. With FHE at its core, sensitive discoveries no longer need to be hidden—they can be computed upon, shared, and governed in a way that respects both openness and privacy.
