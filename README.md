# Confidential Phishing Email Sharing & Analysis

## Overview
Phishing attacks remain one of the most persistent threats in cybersecurity. Individual organizations often detect phishing attempts in isolation, limiting the effectiveness of their defense mechanisms. This project introduces a collaborative platform where multiple companies can contribute encrypted phishing email features—such as URLs and headers—without revealing sensitive data. The core innovation lies in applying Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to make shared training of phishing detection models both secure and privacy-preserving.

## Why FHE Matters
Traditional data sharing frameworks expose organizations to risks: sharing raw phishing samples could inadvertently leak internal structures, sensitive communication, or employee information. FHE provides a breakthrough—data remains encrypted not only at rest and in transit but also during computation. This ensures that collaborative machine learning on phishing datasets is possible without any participant ever accessing another's unencrypted data.

By leveraging FHE:
- Encrypted email features can be aggregated safely across organizations.
- Detection models improve continuously as more encrypted samples are shared.
- Real-time signature updates are possible without compromising organizational privacy.

## Key Features
- **Encrypted Feature Sharing**: Email metadata such as URLs and headers are encrypted and pooled across companies.
- **Collaborative FHE Model Training**: A phishing detection model is trained on encrypted datasets, improving accuracy while preserving confidentiality.
- **Dynamic Threat Intelligence**: The system updates phishing signature databases in real-time, helping participants stay resilient against evolving attacks.
- **Security-First Design**: No raw data ever leaves an organization, preventing data leakage or secondary exploitation.

## Architecture Snapshot
1. **Data Preparation**: Local systems extract relevant phishing features and encrypt them using FHE.
2. **Encrypted Aggregation**: Encrypted data is sent to a shared analysis pipeline.
3. **Model Training**: Concrete ML powers collaborative training directly on encrypted values.
4. **Result Distribution**: Updated detection models and phishing signatures are returned to participants, ready for immediate deployment.

## Usage Example
- Prepare encrypted datasets with provided Python utilities.
- Submit encrypted features to the federation server.
- Retrieve updated phishing detection models periodically for deployment in local security infrastructure.

## Technology Stack
- **Concrete ML** for fully homomorphic machine learning computations.
- **Python** for pipeline orchestration and feature encryption.
- **Security tools** integrated for phishing simulation and detection benchmarking.

## Roadmap
- Expand support for additional encrypted email attributes (attachments, message body signals).
- Introduce benchmarking tools for federated FHE training performance.
- Provide deployment guides for integration with enterprise security platforms.

This project is built for researchers and security practitioners seeking a privacy-preserving approach to collaborative phishing defense. By combining the strengths of FHE with real-world cybersecurity challenges, it aims to make joint intelligence both practical and secure.
